        <p class="text"><center>I was born on a sunday evening, December fourth 2005. My parents met in Texas but once they found out about me they moved back to Georgia to be near my mother's family. I was an energetic and curious child, being put in 'gifted' classes at school, and I soon took on a passion for art and animals. My little brother was born when I was seven, and a few years later my parents divorced, leaving my mother to raise us on her own. I spent most of my free time drawing, reading, and playing with my cat, but I enjoyed sports as well; I never missed a season of soccer, not one year. Middle school went by in a flash and I found myself in highschool with a new group of friends and uncertainty ahead of me, as I do not know what to do with my future.</center></p>
